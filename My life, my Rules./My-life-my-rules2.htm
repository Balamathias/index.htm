  <h1>My Life, My rules⟩</h1>
  <h2>Chapter <span>2</span></h2>
  <p>Hannah left the hostel very early in the morning, she wasn't going for lectures, it was as if she had an appointment with someone. Not long after that, she stood on a bridge reminiscing about life. She had grown to hate life so much that she waited for any opportuned time she could at least take her own life. While she stood on the bridge, She was captivated by a moving boat that had just crossed the under-arc section of the bridge. The boat was carrying a group of young ladies displaying weird behavior. Some of the young ladies summoned her to jump from the top of the bridge down to the pool so that she may join them in the boat since she hated everything that concerned <em>Men.</em>She was convinced and since she was willing to take her own life, she jumped from the top of the bridge with a loud scream into the...<q><em><b>JESUS!</b></em></q> Sally screamed from her bed waking Hannah simultaneously. <q>It was a dream, it wasn't real...</q>Sally said regaining consciousness. It was indeed a nightmare!*****</p>
  <p><q>What's the matter? you scared me.</q>Hannah asked confused. Sally hovered her right hand over Hannah to ascertain that she's fully awake and that Hannah was really by her side. After regaining more consciousness, she then believed that it was only a dream. Sally didn't want to disclose the nightmare to Hannah.<q>I had a nightmare but it's nothing serious dear.</q><q>Are you sure about that?</q>,concerned Hannah asked. <q>Yes, I'm fine now. You can go back to bed</q>Sally said.<q>Alright, take care.</q> Hannah said as she rearranged Sally's duvet, petting her to sleep. Hannah had a turbulence in her spirit that something was wrong somewhere because this case was unusual of Sally.<q>Goodnight!</q>, she said as she laid back on her bed.</p>
  <h3>The following morning,</h3>
  <p>Samuel quickly tapped Andrew, his roommate for a morning devotion. He also insisted that they intercede for Sis Sally. After the devotion, As the early morning sun set , they both went outside to engage in some bodily exercises. They're often fond of each other and they did so often.
  <q>Guy, we need to go and prepare for lectures oh, </q>Samuel suggested.<q>Alright bro, there we go...</q>Andrew concurred as they both left to prepare for lectures. On getting to the hostel, they realized that the door to their room was opened! Andrew quietly sneaked in, followed by Samuel...both were surprised at the sight! It was a tender looking fresher! When they understood this, they welcomed him warmly...*****</p>
  <p>Sally woke up disturbed about the previous nightmare. It was thrilling and some part of her believed that something bad was going to happen if something was not done quickly but this convinction was overpassed by the most part of her that believed that telling Hannah the dream would do her more harm and probably discourage her since she was still a struggling Christian. She kept it to herself heartily. <q>How do you feel now Sally, I spent sometime reflecting on your previous night experience.</q>Hannah said quite concerned.<q>Come off it girl, it's nothing... it's just a normal thing okay.</q>Sally flattered.<q>Okay.</q>Hannah said reluctantly.<q>I will be having class this morning, so I need to start preparing...</q>Sally informed<q>Alright, alright</q>, Hannah said as she resorted to making breakfast...*****</p>
  <p>As time went by, the news flung among many ears that a young lady identified as 'Hannah' detests men. She became a matter of discussion among the females. ...but Hannah had her reasons of which <em>ONLY</em> Sally understood.</p>
  <p>Later in the evening of the same day, Sally and Hannah both attended the evening fellowship as they were lifted in the spirit after the Bible study. As they returned to their hostel, a group of females who identified her engaged in a gossip conversation.<q>Sisters, I hear say that girl no dey give guys face oh</q>, one of the sisters stressed, pointing to Hannah as she diffused into the gardened path.<q>I hear the same thing oh, and see as the girl come fine! Wetin really happen ?</q>Another sister admired and asked.<q>Nobody know her tori oh, but she fit get her reasons sha</q>, another sister said.<q>Sisters wey dey gossip!</q> Another sister said to discontinue the gossip conversation. It actually worked. Every of them took to their paths bading one another goodbye.*****</p>
  <h3>At twilight,in the hostel...</h3>
  <p>It was evening already, every one was settled. Sally had just gotten off from the phone with her Dad. She informed Hannah about her next move. Her Daddy had requested that she come home to spend a week or two. Although Sally had been in wait for this kind of opportunity as she had a project she wanted to better sort out at home.</p>
  <p>While she said all these, she felt that Hannah was going to miss her alot but she really had to go home.<q>And what about the general paper we're having on Thursday?</q>,Hannah reminded, <q>Don't worry, that won't be a problem. I'll come over to write it... I'm really gonna miss you Sis, but don't worry. I will be back in short while. Ensure to take care of yourself okay.</q>Sally proposed.<q>Alright, I will.</q>Hannah said with a smile.</p>
  <p>Sally began her preparation the next morning while Hannah, her roommate prepared something she could take before embarking on her journey. Sally informed Hannah that she'd have to go and bade Samuel, her senior course mate goodbye. She also persuaded Hannah to keep her company. This was a situation that involved a <em>Man!</em>It was a quite difficult decision. Although she had heard about Samuel from Sally but that wasn't just enough to alter the instinct of the cruelty of Men! She couldn't turn this request down since it was about her friend,Sally. She sluggishly accepted to accompany Sally...*****</p>
  <p>Samuel on the hand also prepared for his lectures together with Andrew. As they parted ways, Andrew wished Samuel a remarkable and a wonderful moment.<q>Dont crush today oh!</q>Samuel playfully informed Andrew. Andrew chuckled and drew back to where Samuel was, he then said with a low tune<q>I'm a man and you know, crushing is inevitable... I'm not like you that doesn't crush, after all you're an <em>MOG!</em></q>. That got Samuel that he laughed to stupor. <q>If I stay here to listen to you, I will make it late to my lectures...your comedies are so captivating!</q>Samuel said smiling and chuckling along the way as the parted ways finally...</p>
  <p style="font-size:35px">**************</p>
  <p><q>Sis, I'm going to miss you very much.</q> Hannah said quite sad.<q>Don't worry, God will always be by you okay.</q>Sally comforted.<q>Don't forget to put yourself together and overcome any emerging forces that tends to bring you down okay.</q>Sally advised.<q>Okay Sis</q> Hannah complied as they walked along the aisles.</p>
  <p><q>Hey, good day Sister Alice</q>.Sally said waving Alice, the choir-mistress.<q>Hi Sis Sally.</q> Alice waved back with a smile as they walked along the paths. Alice was wearing some medicated glasses and dressed really modest. She is known in the fellowship for her soronous voice. She could sing the archangels down with her voice! She was beautiful in her own way .</p>
  <p>Luckily enough for Sally and Hannah, Samuel was standing with some brothers in a conversation. The morning lectures had been postponed till the evening time. <q>Hi Samuel,</q> Sally baded.<q>Hi, oh Sis Sally. How are you today?</q> Samuel said as he dismissed the other brothers.<q>Oh, I'm very well, thank you!</q> Sally responded with a radiant smile.<q>And who's with you today?</q>. Samuel asked having noticed Hannah.<q>Oh, this is my friend and my roommate</q>. Sally explained.<q>Hi, what's your name?</q>Samuel asked Hannah who was standing in a left angular position towards them. Turning to face them directly and to respond to the question asked by Samuel, Hannah answered<q>I'm Hannah,</q> with a glowing radiant smile as she extended her hand to Samuel's already extended hand. Samuel was completely captivated by Hannah that he was left with awe and great admiration within himself. As for Hannah, it was her first time telling her name to a guy even shaking hands with him! She seemed to enjoy his company, his gestures and his personality! It was as if her mind was moving away from the hatred of men to falling for this guy! She couldn't control such admiration that she excused Sally and Samuel!...</p>
  <p>Having baded Samuel farewell, Sally left for the hostel with her friend Hannah. Sally had thought that Hannah's sudden departure was due to her inability to culture the company of Men! It was a different case this time...*****</p>
