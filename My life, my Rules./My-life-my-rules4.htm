  <h1>My Life, My Rules⟩</h1>
  <h2>Chapter <span>4</span></h2>
  <p>It was already evening as Hannah waited to welcome her new friend,Joan. Not very long after that, Joan showed up. She was actually going for a party but decided to say 'hi' to Hannah. Hannah was very pleased to see her. She also promised to spend sometime with Hannah. They both engaged in a series of discussions that led to Hannah telling Joan her story. Although she doubted within herself that it wasn't right to tell such a story to a newly acquainted friend like Joan but somehow, she trusted that Joan was trustworthy. As the clock ticked away the time and as the story grew so intense, Joan felt pitiful for Hannah that she promised to help her. 
  Hannah appreciated the offer as tears streamed down her eyes. Joan promised to see her soon as she left for the party. ***** </p>
  <p>Samuel turned over his bed thinking about Hannah, he had wished to see her again. He admired her very much. He imagined himself being with her, he imagined himself viewing the whole world together with her and hoping that his mindset would someday become a reality. Although he had wondered how he would be able to see her again. <q>Bro, I hope all is well because you're acting somewhat uncomfortable on that bed.</q>Andrew who had noticed him for sometime informed.<q>Bro, it's about that young lady. I wish I could just see her.</q>Samuel said sitting right on his bed. Andrew chuckled derisively as he felt that Samuel was being unserious.<q>So if you see her now, what do you intend to tell her?</q> Andrew asked Samuel with a suspicious look. Samuel thought for a while and responded <q>I don't know but maybe anything I'm led to say.</q> <q>Bro, you know what, we will talk about this some other time because I can see that you're really tired and probably daydreaming.</q> Andrew said as he laid back on his bed to relax. Samuel tried to convince him of being serious. Andrew barely made fun of him as they lit out...*****<q>Goodnight bro, I really wanna pray.</q> Samuel said.<q>Um...sorry I didn't ask, what's her name? I forgot to ask earlier</q>. Andrew asked expectantly.<q>I won't tell you! Go back to bed bro, see you tomorrow.</q>Samuel stressed ignoring him.<q>Alright, alright. Goodnight!</q> Andrew said as they finally lit out...***** </p>
  <h3>Joan at the party, at night.</h3>
  <p>As Joan landed at the party, the other young ladies present yelled and hailed saying that the <q>big Mama has arrived</q>. She was offered a special seat to sit. The background music continued playing. It was a recently released album of a popular musician that was playing. While the styled red-blue-green* light found it's way towards their part, Joan was offered a bottle of Star* and Life* as She consumed both on the scene. She ordered for more. After a while, she diffused into the dancing section and danced to the the tune of the music. She was 'rocked' by some of the men on the spot. Having had so much fun, she informed some of the ladies that her target was on the way. She emphasized that she had estimated her weakness and that she was prone to falling for her trap. She said all these referring to Hannah.  </p>
  <p>Not long after that, a popular man appeared on the scene with grey beards, wearing a black hat and a walking stick. <q>Sweetheart, today is going to be hot you know, as usual.</q>The man said as he led Joan away from the party scene.<q>And I'm also ready!</q> Joan said as they left the entire party scene with a shiny black Jeep.</p>
  <h3>Alice is embarrassed when her ordeals leaked...</h3>
  <p>As Alice walked along the paths all alone and feeling guilty round about, she was approached by a group of sisters who criticized her secretive behavior! They called her names,'slut','whore','fornicator' and the likes. Her ordeals were equivocally leaked by one of the guys she had had an affair with. He even diplayed some of her nude pictures which supported the fact that it wasn't a set up. She was brought to understand that the news was everywhere!<q>A whole choir-mistress, you have no shame!</q>,One of them stressed. Alice couldn't stand the sight! She felt so embarrassed that she ran out of the scene. It was such a bad day for her...</p>
  <p>When Hannah got the news, she felt pitiful for Alice. It was as if more fuel was added to her rage of hatred for men! She emphasized that the men who defiled her would never be disgraced so inhumanly. It's only the ladies that takes all the blames and all the shame...***</p>
  <p>Many persons emphasized on Alice's stupidity and pretence! Alice regretted ever being born pending on the situation. She felt that it was not needful to live anymore. Life was going to be meaningless for her, she thought of committing suicide and made plans towards it.*****</p>
  <p><q>Have you heard the news?</q> Concerned Andrew asked uniformed Samuel.<q>Nope, what news?</q>Samuel asked.<q>I have a burden in my heart that we should pray for Sister Alice right now! She was caught fornicating and the news is all over the school and the media!</q>. Andrew informed.<q>What!</q>Samuel exclaimed.<q>Not only that, some of her nude pictures are hovering around the school! We need to pray for her now, no one knows her state of being.</q> Andrew suggested as they held hands to prayed for Alice.</p>
  <p>Alice began paving her way of taking her own life, She sat down hopeless and helpless in a solitary place that appeared really tattered. She took all the courage at her disposal and went to a nearby pharmacy, where she bought bought a powerful poisonous substance.She was prepared to die! She couldn't just live to face the humiliation! She managed her way back to her solitary place...***</p>
  <p>Samuel was deeply disturbed in the spirit amidst the prayers that they should go after Alice immediately but how were they going to find her? Andrew suggested that they go in search of her while the holy spirit takes care of the direction. Both friends moved around the campus in search of Alice, as well as asking some people about her whereabouts. Something bad was going to happen if they don't find sis Alice immediately.</p>
  <p>While she sat reminiscing about how useless she has become, Alice made up her mind and opened the sealed poisonous content. She uttered her last words...<q>Forgive me father.</q> as she bent it over her mouth.<q>JESUS!</q>, Samuel exclaimed Just as it was about to diffuse into her mouth. The shock brought about by the loud scream landed the container straight to the soil!<q>Allow me to go, my life is meaningless! My whole life is a mess!</q> Alice said pleading with whoever it was.<q>No Alice, your life is not a mess! In fact you have greater hope and greater glory ahead.</q> Samuel said squatting to her level and keeping away the poison very far from her.<q>You know that's not possible, I can't live anymore, allow me!</q> Alice pleaded.<q>No! you were not born to die, infact Jesus is ready to recreate and to rewrite your story. Give him a chance to do that sister Alice, please!</q> Samuel said pleading and comforting Alice as they led her to a more comfortable place...*****</p>
  <p>*****... <q>There is hope in Jesus Christ. God is ready to give you a fresh start Sis Alice.</q>Samuel informed.<q>Yes, salvation is only for those who are righteous, I am not in the number. I would find peace if you could just let me go, please!</q>Alice said pleading incessantly.<q>No! Salvation is for the lost! Jesus left ninety-nine sheeps in search of one Sister Alice, and you are that <em>ONE!</em></q> Samuel informed.<q>How do I face the world after this, can't you just let me go? I don't want to encounter what is likely to happen after this.</q>Alice said lamenting and weeping profusely.<q>No Sis Alice, you're not facing the world this time. The world is not your record keeper, but you are facing Jesus this time!</q> Samuel stressed.<q>Jesus is willing to take you back and to hold you to himself and to make you look like himself!</q> Andrew added.<q>Jesus is ready to restore your dignity and your worth! All you need right now is to give in to Jesus.</q>Samuel informed.<q>Please pray for me</q>. Alice requested after being so much convinced.***** both friends prayed for her as the day grew darker.*****</p>
