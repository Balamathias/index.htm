  <h1>My Life, My Rules‚ü©</h1>
  <h2>Chapter <span>5</span></h2>
  <p><q>I'm ready to help you Hannah if you are ready to comply with what I have to offer.</q>Joan said. Hannah was willing to comply with whatever Joan had to offer.<q>I am going straight to the point and it's left for you to make your choice.</q> Joan said with a serious expression.<q>I'm ready to do that which will help me earn. I have been going through alot in this school especially the cases of financial restraints. Please help me out.</q> Hannah said pleading. Joan informed Hannah that she would have really said that she needed a man who could pay her for her services but countered it with the fact that Hannah hated men! In an attempt to help her, Joan proposed same gender affairs!<q>You mean lesbianism?</q> Hannah questioned intensely!<q>Yes, just come to think of how men have been so cruel to you...just...</q>.<q>No!</q>Hannah yelled.<q>If that is what you do then I am out! Now get out of my room!</q>.Hannah ordered with rage.<q>Has it gotten to that? I was only trying to help you</q>. Joan said composing and picking up her handbag.<q>Get out!</q>Hannah ordered again.<q>I will leave, I will leave.</q>Joan said with a ridiculous look.<q>To hell with your help!, Leave!</q> Hannah said opening the door and miming 'out!' with her index finger.<q>but I'm promising you this. You will come back on your knees crawling for my help!</q> Joan said leaving. Hannah slammed the door behind her and sat back on her bed with a thud reminiscing about life....*****</p>
  <p><q>It was a remarkable encounter for Alice. She felt the freedom she had lacked for long. She had lived her life on pretence and concealing of the darkness that was in her heart, but now she's happy to live.</q> Andrew informed Samuel.<q>Oh heavens! I cannot imagine the joy in heaven right now.</q> Samuel said lifting his hands up to heaven.<q>We really appreciate God for her life. Now she's happy, the LORD will rewrite her story.</q>Andrew said with an overflowing joy in his heart.</p>
  <p><q>What about that your first love?</q> Andrew asked referring to Hannah with the intention to ridicule Samuel.<q>You mean...Hannah?</q>Samuel asked in return.<q>Yes! I've longed for this. She has this beautiful name called Hannah! Wow!</q>Andrew laughed as he made fun of Samuel's unconscious pronunciation of Hannah's name.<q>Oh what! I didn't mean to tell you her name right now.</q> Samuel said pretending to regret.<q>Haha, but I'm thinking about something...</q>Andrew uttered putting on a serious face. Samuel was captivated by that he asked Andrew what he was thinking about.<q>Hannah was the mother of Samuel!</q> Andrew bursted as he laughed to stupor. Samuel blushed and admitted that he was actually 'falling' for her. Samuel was restrained by the idea that he may never be opportuned to talk to Hannah again...but Andrew urged him that everything was under control as they took up their Bibles to study.*****</p>
  <p>While at the fellowship the following day, A new choir-mistress was installed while Alice was stepped down pending on the accusations that was found truthful against her. When Alice heard about it, she appreciated God for giving her the time to build herself up. It became a season of making for her.</p>
  <h3>Hannah meets Alice...,</h3>
  <p><q>Sis Alice, I'm very sorry about what happened to you recently. It wasn't your fault.</q> Hannah said sympathizing with Alice.<q>It's okay now Hannah, I'm fine. I have met Jesus myself this time, I am renewed.</q>Alice said wiping a drop of tear that had emerged from her eye.<q>Thank you for coming and for caring. God will bless you!</q>. Alice said <q>And bless you too dear.</q>Hannah added. Hannah urged Alice to take care of herself as she was preparing to leave. She promised to see her some other time when everything is settled for a better discussion on this matter. Hannah baded her goodbye as she exited the room.</p>
  <p style="font-size:35px">*************</p>
  <p>Hannah phoned her mom for some funds to help her scale through as she was desperately in need of funds for her handouts and a few assignments. It was a sad reply, her mom informed her that she was recently denied of her small provision  store she was managing. It was reported that a few men had claimed it to be theirs on legal terms and She couldn't attain justice as she was only a woman of meager income managing a Single daughter, Hannah. Hannah was not happy with the news. Her mom also informed her that she had gone bankrupt and may not be able to sponsor her education again. Hannah broke down into tears on hearing the news. She cursed men for their cruelty. She deleted every manly feelings she had and thought about what to do next. When she realized that there was no other option left for her to take, she made up her mind to reconcile with Joan in order to keep on...*****</p>
  <p>The next day, Hannah's mind was made up! A whooping sum of<em>One Million</em> for just a night! Hannah thought to herself. She promised herself to do this only once and that would be all since one million was enough to help her out through out her university.</p>
  <p>Hannah searched for Joan in one of the possible addresses she once dropped with her. She was quite fortunate enough to find her sitting under a shade with her other friends. They were actually waiting for an appointed time to commence their hangouts as usual. Hannah walked across to Joan slowly and feeling ashamed of her earlier reactions to her. When she finally succeeded in getting Joan's attention, Hannah began by apologizing for her behavior the other day.<q>No! Don't worry, it's not a problem. I've actually experienced such many times, so it's actually nothing. I wasn't angry.</q> Joan assured.<q>So have you made up your mind now?</q> Joan asked expectantly.<q>Yes! I'm ready.</q>Hannah responded with great readiness. <q>Alright ladies, this 'babe' will be joining us tonight!</q> Joan communicated to the other ladies who hailed her witty personality.<q>We would be leaving by 10pm tonight!</q> Joan informed and Hannah  concurred.*****</p>
  <h3>At the party, with Joan...,</h3>
  <p>The party scene was quite crowdy this time, Joan welcomed Hannah warmly and met every of her demands. She was persuaded to taste alcohol to feel what it was like. She gulped and felt some strange taste which caused her to empty her mouth instantly. This captured the attention of many persons who were at the party. They stared and laughed at her silly behavior. Just then, while the party music continued playing, The man on a black hat, with a black jeep and with a walking stick showed up. His dressing was the type befitting to a way-prostitute-picker*. He was called Chief Donalds. When He noticed Joan from a distance, he also noticed a new face, a radiant face that stood out among all faces! It was that of Hannah! Chief Donalds wittily walked around the zone at which the ladies were sitting in order to examine her package*. The 'Chief' discovered that Hannah was well loaded! He sought out every possible means he could get to have her tonight. That was his desire.*****</p>
  <p><em>Jesus!</em> Samuel screamed from his bed waking Andrew up at the same time. Andrew asked what the matter was and Samuel narrated that he had a nightmare and that it concerned Hannah. When Andrew heard that it was about Hannah, he informed Samuel that <q>Out of multiples of our thoughts cometh dreams.</q> Andrew flattered Samuel that it was nothing serious. Samuel struggled to emphasize on how real it was but was completely convinced that it was because of his 'many thinkings' about Hannah. Samuel slept back...***** </p>
  <p>*****...Chief Donalds summoned Joan and explained to her about his interest in Hannah. He also offered to pay her anything if she could grant him that offer. Joan explained that she was for 'Super-mama' and not for any man. She'd not succumb to any man! Joan kept on emphasizing.<q>I'm ready to give you <em>Three million Naira</em> if you can do just that!</q>Chief Donalds proposed. When Joan heard that, she agreed immediately. 'Super mama' was only going to offer Eight Hundred thousand Naira! This was a great opportunity for her! She promised to make everything set. This was not going to be by agreement anymore, it may also involve coercion!</p>
  <p>Chief Donalds decided to move closer to Hannah to know her in person. Hannah denied him response on the grounds that he was a man! Hannah also noticed his dark shinning wrist watch and seemed to admire it.<q>It must be very expensive though.</q> Hannah thought to herself.</p>
  <p>While they were still soaring on the winds of pleasure, A glass cup of soft drink was brought to Hannah from Joan. After taking the drink, Hannah felt somewhat dizzy. Not long after that, she said that she was heavy with sleep...*****...*****Joan succeeded in her plans and sleepily led away Hannah with Chief Donalds who r*ped her..., leaving her alone in the hotel room the following day. </p>
