  <h2 class="abc">The Advent of the internet is a bad omen.
</h2>
   <div class="coln">
<p>Good day Mr. Chairman, the panel of Judges, the ultimate time regulator, my co-debaters and the audience. I am ...(name)... and I am here to claim the motion that says: "the advent of the internet is a bad omen". The preceding paragraphs supports my claim.</p>

<p>The internet is supportively one of the greatest discoveries of the modern world. The influence of the internet on the world and it's impacts cannot be overemphasized. It is inarguable to assert that the internet has become the best means of socialization, marketing, research and the likes. The importance of the internet also ranges from small-scale to large-scale businesses. Despite all the abovementioned importance and influence of the internet, the internet has been and would remain a bad invention.</p>

<p>The internet with it's numerous and diversified usage is nonetheless a stand out factor in community growth impediments. To start with is the cyber-crimes brought about by the internet. It's a fact to hold unto that the future lies on the shoulders of the youths and the adolescents but for the discovery of the internet, the reverse is seen. The internet has become a standard of gambling by many persons. A large percentage of people all over the world make use of the internet but internet abuse has made the discovery a regret! The rate of crimes recorded daily on the internet basis is alarming. It may be said that the internet has become a part of the modern world as the world cannot do without it, No! I object to that idea. The rate of moral decadence brought about by the discovery of the internet cannot be restituted.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the internet has become a measure of antisocial behavior and high immorality records! This is a case whereby many persons especially the young ones pay expensive amounts to access highly expensive cyber-sexual and cyber-porn displays on adult websites. Majority of these youths would have been better off without the internet. The society would be a better place if the internet had never been invented! In some sense, the internet has become an indispensable tool for many persons but unfortunately, due to overdependence on the internet on their daily living, it ends up affecting their daily lives. The internet may intrude their privacies, it may trigger uncontrollable sexual urges that may affect many persons who tend to fall victims. This situations were unheard when the internet was absent. Morality was highly valued. Adolescents were banned from such engagements but it's quite unfortunate that these days, the internet has turned the society into a disgusting social edifice.
</p>
<p>Moreso, no one can deny the fact thaf life would be boring and inconvenient without the internet but the  downsizing roles played by the internet nowadays is nothing to write home about. The internet plays a major role in education and other positive engagements but the same internet is preoccupied with several negativities. The internet has become a medium of cheating. Hardwork is no longer recognized. Human resource developments is no longer advised. This is against the educative norms of the academic processes.
</p>
<p>However, the role of the internet in curtailing crime is superb but the irony is that the internet is only used to curtail the crimes brought about by it. It's not a bad idea to say that there is a significant difference between the internet users and internet addicts. In fact, there is only a very infinitesimal percentage of internet users as compared to internet addicts. Griffin argued the above mentioned fact so well. To support this, it's not deniable to relate that cyber-criminals and the persons engaged in other internet related crimes spend a proportionate part of their lives sorting out ways of cheating people and some sort of gambling. The internet also withers the business mindedness of many investors due to the high rate of scamming here and there. The issue of internet addiction is one of the most downsizing parts of the advent of the internet. It does not only stop there, it continues as far as subjecting many young ones to some sort of repulsive educational and developmental engagements. The internet has summarily set a limit to human intelligence.
</p>
<p>To scale further, it was estimated that internet dependents spent 38.5 hours on a weekly average scale while non dependents spent 4.9hours on a weekly basis in a 2005 survey. The proportionate percentage of the population that engaged in the addiction protocol were mostly the youthful population. A situation whereby moral values is only for old-timers. Morality is considered old-fashioned. The high rate of internet cheating in Nigeria is a thing of great consideration. This is because everyone want to make it quick. This means that hardwork is of less importance. The internet is indeed a bad omen!</p>

<p>Finally, even with it's numerous positive impacts, the world would have been better off without the internet. The internet has also become  a measure of slander and libel, privacy is no longer respected. Many criminal reports here and there attributory to the mistaken-internet-invention*.
</p>
<p>In conclusion, it's not a matter of controversy but a situation that the society should rethink and reconsider the effect of the advent of the internet. Even though the internet is a technological invention, it would always be a bad omen! There many other delimiting factors of the internet but time and space wouldn't permit the reconsideration of other factors.
</p>
 <p>I hope that with these few-out-of-many* points of mine, I have been able to make it convincing to you all that the advent of the internet is indeed a bad omen.</p>


<p>Thank you!</p></div>
